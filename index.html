Comic books are a perfect example of evolving media. Originally, they were printed in books and newspapers, where sizes were predictable. Today, comic books are still around but on digital devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Your task is to create a mobile responsive comic that looks good on any size device. To accomplish this, you need the Materialize CSS library (https://materializecss.com/) and its grid component (https://materializecss.com/grid.html). Additionally, you may want to use an AI powered image generator, such as Stable Diffusion (https://stablediffusion.fr/demo).

The content is up to you. You can put many comic panels on one page, with a few different pages. Try to experiment with different layouts on each page. You will probably need to use container tags!
